So you're using [gistup](https://github.com/mbostock/gistup) to create gists (and [blocks](http://bl.ocks.org/)) from the command line.  If not, see this [tutorial](http://bost.ocks.org/mike/block/) for a quick overview.  

And now you want to add thumbnails to your gists so that your [blocks portfolio](http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock) looks all pretty, right. How?

To have a thumbnail associated with your gist you need to create a 230 x 120
pixel PNG image file named `thumbnail.png` and include this at the top-level of
your gist's repo (generated by `gistup`).

The main trick is in finding an appropriate image and then right-sizing it for
the 230 x 120 dimensions that the blocks site expects your `thumbnail.png` to
be.

If you're pulling a pre-existing image, you can use Preview (at least Mac users
can) to resize and crop the image as needed.  You'll need to ...

* crop the base image for proper framing
* resize to the lesser of 230 width or 120 height
* copy and paste the resized base image into a thumbnail template (see `thumbnail-template.png`) with the exact sizing needed
* export as `thumbnail.png`

If you've already got a gist with an `index.html` file that renders something
at the top of its associated block, you can use the following steps to get a
screenshot of that rendering to use as the basis of your thumbnail:

* Go to your block, e.g., `bl.ocks.org/4060606`
* `Command-Shift-4`, drag a 960x500 box inside the gray border of the 
  rendered content
* Double click the gist number (4060606) and copy
* Paste to rename the new screenshot (becomes 4060606.png)
* Resize with GraphicsMagick via 
  `gm convert -resize 230x120 ~/Desktop/4060606.png thumbnail.png`
* Add the resulting thumbnail to your repo via 
  `git add thumbnail.png && git commit -m 'Add thumbnail.' && git push`
