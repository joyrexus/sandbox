Use [gistup](https://github.com/mbostock/gistup) to create gists (and
[blocks](http://bl.ocks.org/)) from the command line.  The directory containing
your gist files gets initialized as a git repo.  See this
[tutorial](http://bost.ocks.org/mike/block/) for a quick overview.

For additional tips on generating block thumbnails, see this
[block](https://gist.github.com/mbostock/3953793) and this
[HOWTO](http://visfest.com/d3unconf/how-to.html).
