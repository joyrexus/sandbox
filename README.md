# Sandbox

The sandbox is for quick experimentation and general hackery.


## To Do

Skim ...

* [Fast interactive prototyping with sketch and d3](http://snips.net/blog/posts/2014/01-10-fast-interactive_prototyping_with_d3_js.html)

* Michael Ficarra's slides on the [foundations of functional design](https://speakerdeck.com/michaelficarra/wip-foundations-of-functional-design-abstract-algebra-and-category-theory)

Try ...

* [search-index](https://github.com/fergiemcdowall/search-index) - Lucene for
  node, but simpler

* [dat](https://github.com/maxogden/dat#what-is-dat) - real-time replication
  and versioning for large tabular data sets

* [bacon.js](https://github.com/baconjs/bacon.js#intro) + d3 [sliding window example](https://github.com/michaelficarra/bacon.js/blob/master/examples/sliding_window.html).

* [observable](https://github.com/dominictarr/observable) - using a function to
  represent and track mutable values

* [shoe.js](https://github.com/substack/shoe) - streaming sockjs for node and
  the browser

* [through2](https://github.com/rvagg/through2) - tiny wrapper around `streams.Transform`

* [co-stream](https://github.com/juliangruber/co-stream) - co generator
  stream spec

* [co-from-stream](https://github.com/juliangruber/co-from-stream) - create a
  co generator stream from a node stream

* [co-map](https://github.com/juliangruber/co-map) - map a co generator stream
  over a function
