1. Extend SVG.Doc with a Point class that draws a point.

2. Extend SVG.Doc with a LabeledPoint class that draws a labeled point.

3. Extend SVG.Doc with a LabeledPath class (based on SVG.polyline) 
   that draws a labeled path.

4. Extend SVG.Doc with a Cursor class with `moveTo` and `lineTo` methods.
