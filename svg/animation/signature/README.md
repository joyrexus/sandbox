Quick demo of how to sequentially animate multiple paths in an svg following
Jake Archibald's [techinque](http://jakearchibald.com/2013/animated-line-drawing-svg).

See [this gist](http://bl.ocks.org/joyrexus/6925840) for the simpler single-path variant.

We used [InkPad](https://github.com/sprang/Inkpad) to generate our signature on
an iPad Mini as it has an export/email option.  [Method Draw](http://editor.method.ac) might also be useful for such freehand sketching and export.
