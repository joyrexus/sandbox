Animate the movement of a bug along a curve while tracing/erasing path.

Demonstrates how to use the [getTotalLength](http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/paths.html#__svg__SVGPathElement__getTotalLength) and [getPointAtLength](http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/paths.html#__svg__SVGPathElement__getPointAtLength) methods on SVG path elements to interpolate a point along an existing path ... as well as how to animate the path using "stroke-dash interpolation", previously demo-ed [here](http://bl.ocks.org/joyrexus/6925840).

Built with [svg.js](https://github.com/wout/svg.js) and inspired by [@johan](http://bl.ocks.org/johan)'s much slicker [D3-variant](http://bl.ocks.org/johan/1315145).  Also check out @mbostock's [Stroke Dash Interpolation](http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/5649592) block.
